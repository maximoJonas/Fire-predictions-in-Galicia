# Fire-predictions-in-Galicia
You can see the next 4 days prediccion
After hard work collecting all the necessary data and data analysis and cleaning of the data, I also get to predict the possibility of fires in Galicia by the weather stations,
that give me the predictions of temperature, humidity, wind... with a randonForestTree classifier see the risk of fire since I trained the machine with 15 years of fire collection.
You can also see a future prediction of the temperature that will be the day that the user wants in a point of Galicia for example: on September 2, 2050 in Santiago.
In addition, you can see on a map with the Folium library the fires by years that existed and the hectares burned and the cost that it entailed for the city council.

It was so big and there was so much code that it was done on several notebooks, saving the data collected in different csv files to be able to read them from the other notebooks.
